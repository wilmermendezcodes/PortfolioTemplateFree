# IMMEDIATE FIX: "Application is starting up" Issue

## The Problem
Your app shows "Application is starting up" because the server can't find the built React files.

## IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

Run these commands in your project directory:

```bash
# 1. Stop your current server (Ctrl+C)

# 2. Delete old build files
rm -rf dist

# 3. Rebuild everything
npm run build

# 4. Start with correct environment
NODE_ENV=development PORT=3000 npm run dev
```

## Alternative Quick Fix

If the above doesn't work, try this automated fix:

```bash
node fix-local.js
```

This script will:
- Check and rebuild missing files
- Create proper .env configuration
- Start the server correctly

## Manual Debug Steps

1. **Check if build files exist:**
   ```bash
   ls -la dist/public/
   ```
   You should see `index.html` and `assets/` folder

2. **If build files are missing:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Check your .env file:**
   ```env
   NODE_ENV=development
   PORT=3000
   ```

4. **Start with explicit settings:**
   ```bash
   PORT=3000 NODE_ENV=development npm run dev
   ```

## What Was Wrong
The server was looking for build files in the wrong directory. The fix ensures it finds the React app files in `dist/public/` where they're actually built.

## Verify It's Working
After fixing, you should see:
- Your React app loads at http://localhost:3000
- No more "Application is starting up" message
- You can interact with the recommendation features

The app should now work properly with authentication and recommendations!
