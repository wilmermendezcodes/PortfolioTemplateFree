# FINAL DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## Problem
Vite's build process has persistent path resolution issues with `/src/main.tsx` in the HTML file, preventing successful Vercel deployment.

## Solution
Created a **completely custom build script** (`build-custom.js`) that:
- **Bypasses Vite entirely** 
- **Uses esbuild directly** for React bundling
- **Manually processes the HTML file** to fix script paths
- **Creates proper directory structure** for Vercel
- **Builds the API function** separately

## Build Process
1. **Install dependencies** via npm
2. **Build React app** with esbuild (same engine as Vite)
3. **Process HTML file** to replace problematic script tag
4. **Copy static assets** from client/public
5. **Build API function** for serverless deployment
6. **Verify all outputs** exist and are valid

## Vercel Configuration
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "node build-custom.js",
  "outputDirectory": "dist/public"
}
```

## Benefits
- ✅ **No Vite path resolution issues**
- ✅ **Direct control over build process**
- ✅ **Faster builds** (esbuild is very fast)
- ✅ **Production optimizations** (minification, bundling)
- ✅ **Clean output structure** for Vercel

## Expected Result
Your next Vercel deployment will:
1. Complete the build process successfully
2. Deploy your React app to Vercel's edge network
3. Configure serverless API endpoints properly
4. Provide a working production application

This approach completely eliminates the Rollup/Vite configuration issues that were blocking deployment.
