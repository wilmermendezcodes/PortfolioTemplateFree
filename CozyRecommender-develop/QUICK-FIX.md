# VERCEL DEPLOYMENT FIX

## Issue
Vercel build was failing due to esbuild not being found and path resolution issues.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Build Script Path
- Changed from `npx esbuild` to `./node_modules/.bin/esbuild`
- This ensures esbuild is found from the installed dependencies

### 2. Reverted to Standard Build Command
- Updated `vercel.json` to use `npm run build` instead of custom script
- This leverages the existing, tested build configuration

### 3. Build Process Now:
```bash
npm run build
```
Which runs:
```bash
npx vite build && npx esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist
```

## Expected Result
- Frontend builds to `dist/public/`
- API function builds to `api/index.js`
- Vercel deployment completes successfully

## Next Steps
1. Redeploy the project in Vercel
2. The build should now complete without errors
3. Your app will be live at your Vercel domain

The standard build command has been working locally, so it should work in Vercel's environment as well.
