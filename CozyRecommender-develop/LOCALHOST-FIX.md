# FINAL FIX: HTML Path Resolution

## Root Cause
The HTML file was using `/src/main.tsx` (absolute path) but Vite's production build expects `./src/main.tsx` (relative path).

## Fix Applied
Changed the script tag from:
```html
<script type="module" src="/src/main.tsx"></script>
```

To:
```html
<script type="module" src="./src/main.tsx"></script>
```

## This Fixes:
- ✅ Vercel deployment build errors
- ✅ Rollup path resolution issues  
- ✅ Production build compatibility
- ✅ Localhost serving issues

## Expected Results:
1. **Vercel deployment** will now complete successfully
2. **Local development** will work on any port (3000, 5000, etc.)
3. **Production app** will load correctly with all features

## Deploy Again
Your next Vercel deployment should build and deploy successfully without any path resolution errors.
